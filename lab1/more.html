						<p>Man has always attracted the sea. He could endlessly enjoy the view of the sea. The sea lives its own life. The life of movement, excitement, beauty.</p>
						<p>Do we see, notice the beauty of the sea?</p>
						<p>We live in big cities, far from the sea, we should not deal with this, that the sea is a beautiful creation of nature, the whole universe, living by its own laws and rules.</p>

					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-4">
						<p>The sea is a symbol of freedom, space, beauty. The splash of the sea, its fresh, moist, salty breath, indomitable character, captivates.</p>
						<p>The sea is warm and inviting, angry and terrible, bright and quiet, harsh and cold. The sea is wealth. It will feed, deliver to the desired point, heal, give positive emotions, soothe the soul. But, like the medal, there are two sides to the sea. Facial, when its laws are observed, and reverse, when carelessness comes to the fore. At sea, be careful!</p>
						<p>There are seas with beautiful names - White, Yellow, Red, Coral, Marble. There are seas that wash many countries. These seas include the Baltic, Mediterranean, Caribbean, and Northern.</p>

					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-4">
						<p>The sea air is especially beautiful. It does not contain dust at all, it contains a lot of oxygen and ozone. Ions of sodium, potassium, iodine are present in the sea air in sufficient quantities. Anyone who takes air baths near the sea is absolutely correct. They have a positive effect on the entire body.</p>
						<p>From infancy, children are carried away by the very thing. The sea itself belongs to such a “very-very” one. But mere admiration and admiring is not enough. It is important to remember this feeling of the sea, save it.</p>
